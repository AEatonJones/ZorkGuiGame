Game:			 	          Shrek Adventures

Game outline:

The player plays as the character “Shrek” who roams around a series of creepy shacks searching for his missing family. The buildings contain clues as to the whereabouts to his family. The game will be a top-down experience. The player will navigate through the various rooms, solving clues to save his family from grave peril!

Map:

The map updates when the player enters a room, revealing the current room and previously entered rooms on the map. The rooms are labelled with descriptions which best convey their appearance. These room names may be referenced in the clues in some way which helps the player navigate through the game. 

Journal:

The player keeps a journal which the character “Shrek” records his clues and other findings. This feature can be accessed on the user-interface and will help the player when deciphering clues. 

Items:

The character can interact with various objects placed in the rooms. These items may be clues which are essential for locating the Shrek family.

Possible features:

Weight – Each family member Shrek saves, the slower he becomes; Making the load a burden to Shrek’s movement. Perhaps there can be a safe room “Shrek’s house” where the player can drop a family member?

Time Limit – Shrek’s family has been poisoned. Can Shrek save them all? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!

Unlocking secret rooms – The collection of two clues connecting to one family member, and the interaction to an object makes a new room to be accessible.

Items: Antidotes for Shrek’s family. Speed potions for Shrek. A potion that reveals a random room. Inventory cap – Shrek can only hold up to 20 items.
